# Starting with OCaml

For general instructions on installing OCaml and setting it up with
VSCode, refer to
[here](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/install.html). If
VSCode isn't your cup of tea, don't worry; a high-quality OCaml
plugins is likely available for your favorite editor as well (E.g.,
merlin for emacs).

## Install QCheck and Alcotest

Our programming assignments will depend on the QCheck and Alcotest
libraries for automated testing, which can be installed via opam with
the following command:

```
opam install qcheck alcotest qcheck-alcotest
```

## OCaml Documentation

Once our programming assignments get going, you may often find OCaml's
[online documentation](https://v2.ocaml.org/api/) to be useful.
